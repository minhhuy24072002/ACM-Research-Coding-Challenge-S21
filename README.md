In this project a mainly use biopython. With biopython I can read genbank file with SeqIO then extract information about gene name, start, end, strand,... With GenomeDiagram I can draw linear or circular genome graph. However, I have change something to make my graph more understandable. Firstly I change the direction of negative strand to clockwise so that the viewer so that if it negative or positive strand the viewer can look at the graph more understandable. Secondly, I random the color to set for each of gene for the graph to help viewer distinguish between different genes. Finally, I add an inner circle to show to data of start and end of genes so that the viewer have more informations.
